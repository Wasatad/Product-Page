## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Vuex.js](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - State manager
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- [Vue-Agile](https://github.com/lukaszflorczak/vue-agile) - A carousel component for Vue.js inspired by Slick

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on creating a good looking responsive layout. Also, I get a great practice in implementing and setting gallery component "Vue-Agile", and had an exercise in validation user's entered data (amount of products).
